Carme Miquel's, website. A valencian writter. A (work in progress) static rework of [guill3m/CarmeMiquel.com-v2](https://github.com/guill3m/CarmeMiquel.com-v2)

## Why does this repository exist?

The original site was built with Wordpress as it was intended to hace continious content added to it. Today, the site is frozen and is intended to stay as an archive without additional content updates.

As CMS capabilities are not a necessity anymore I decided to rework the site into a static site using Astro both to learn the framework and because I think this is the most appropriate tool to build this new iteration of the site considering the needs: static, very little reactivity, content driven.

I will also use this opportunity to add some small enhancements to the site based on learnings since the original site was launched.
