# www.CarmeMiquel.com

Official website for the valencian writer Carme Miquel. This site contains information about the author and her published books as well as some interviews, a vast collection of her weekly opinion columns published in the Levante EMV newspaper, and promotional videos of some of her books.

A (work in progress) static rework of [guill3m/CarmeMiquel.com-v2](https://github.com/guill3m/CarmeMiquel.com-v2) with Astro.

## Why does this repository exist?

The original site in 2009 was a static site, then it was re-built with Wordpress in 2012 as it was expanded and the author wanted to have more content added to it regularly. Today, the site is considered as frozen in time and is intended to stay as an archive without significant content updates.

As CMS capabilities are not a necessity anymore I decided to rework the site into a static site using Astro both to learn the framework and because I think this is the most appropriate tool to build this new iteration of the site considering we need a static site, with very little reactivity, and it is content driven (even if n9ot regularly updated anymore).

I will also use this opportunity to add some small enhancements to the site based on learnings since the original site was launched.
